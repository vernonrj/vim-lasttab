INTRODUCTION                                    *lasttab*

This is a small plugin for selecting the previously-used tab. As a bonus, it
also provides an overwritable mapping for easily selecting the previously-used
buffer.

Vim 7 is necessary for tab functionality.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                        *lasttab-mappings*

The mappings in this plugin are designed to avoid conflicts by using |<Plug>|.
To define your own keymappings for them, you can edit your |vimrc|.

  Functionality           Mapping                        Default~
  Previously-used tab     <Plug>LastTabLastUsedTab       <M-`>
  Previously-used buffer  <Plug>LastTabLastUsedBuffer    <Leader>`

Custom mappings for these commands would look something like:
>
  nmap <Leader>FOO <Plug>LastTabLastUsedTab
  nmap <Leader>BAR <Plug>LastTabLastUsedBuffer
<
Where `FOO` and `BAR` are whatever you want.

If you already have mappings for the default mappings, the plugin will throw
an error at load time, rather than overwriting your existing mappings. You'll
have to define custom mappings for the plugin that don't conflict in order to
eliminate the error.
